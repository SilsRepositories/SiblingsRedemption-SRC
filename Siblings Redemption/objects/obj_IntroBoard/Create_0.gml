// Long ago, two races ruled over Earth, HUMANs and MONSTERs.
// After the great war, the monsters were sealed underground.
// Over the years, the monsters became frightened of humanity.
// Bloodthirsty, a human made it their job to eradicate them for good.
// The human became so powerful, even Sans couldn't stop them.
// ASGORE became afraid, and decided he wasn't going down easily.
// The human struggled, but eventually reigned victorious.
// As ASGORE's son, Flowey, fell to the ground, he came up with a plan.
// If Chara ever came back to life through their DETERMINATION...
// He and Chara would pull no punches in one last battle.
// Together, both would get revenge on the human.
// With their combined power, they will achieve REDEMPTION.
