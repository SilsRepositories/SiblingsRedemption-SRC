# Welcome!
This is the source code for my most popular game, Siblings Redemption.

I have decided to make it public after a long time of consideration, and also to provide insight to what makes it the way that it is.

Note that this is based off of my Undertale Engine, which you can download here: https://github.com/SilsRepositories/UT-CodeSnippets

Moreover, most of the bugs in the engine have been fixed in Siblings Redemption.

The game on the GameJolt (https://gamejolt.com/games/siblings_redemption/593864) is compiled in YYC, which means that you won't be able to edit the code with UndertaleModTool, as YYC compiles GameMaker Language to machine code.

That's partly why I released this source code.
# Terms of Use
This code has been supplied to allow modding and exporting onto other platforms like Android/Mac/Linux (with a catch, read below!), as I do not possess the capabilities to do that legally.

By extension, I will tell you what you can and cannot do with this code.
### You CAN...
- Use the code as reference for non-profit work, such as school projects or personal experiments.
- **I will let you use this as an engine for your Undertale fangame, if you give credit. I think this goes without saying.**
- Mess around with it in your own personal private time. By this, I mean seeing how the debug mode works or playing around with the stats for curiosity purposes.
- Make QoL (quality-of-life) mods. Again, I would rather you ONLY do this with my permission.
### You CANNOT...
- Sell the game or add microtransactions. Profiting off of fangames is strictly prohibited by law. **I will not be held responsible if you receive a lawsuit at your doorstep!**
  - Talking of which, see the next bullet in the list for the next thing you cannot do.
- Reupload the game without my permission. I **WILL** take your project down if you do this. (Only exceptions are if you are porting the game to Android/Mac/Linux, in which case please get in touch with me first so I know what you're doing)
  - Due to the ease of modding, I will decide what constitutes as a reupload. If you mod it heavily, you should be fine, but if you hardly make any changes at all, then don't fancy your game's chances of survival.
- Pass it off as your own work when submitting it as a project. This is plagiarism and I do not condone it.
- Upload any of the music elsewhere. I do not own the majority of the tracks, so I cannot be held responsible for any strikes you receive.
# Special Thanks
- YoYo Games, for creating the engine that had started one of the most popular communities to date.
- Merg for playing this game, even if I'm not that happy with the game now.
- Toby Fox for making Undertale and bringing us all together.
- All of my playtesters and helpers. They have helped to shape the game to what it is today.
- And you, for playing. =)
